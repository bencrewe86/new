              <h3><u>How We Began</u></h3>
              <p>Award-winning professional training QA Ltd was formed in 1985 
                  by three former Intel employees:
              <b> Mike Cheeseman, Jim Watt and Howard Kornstein</b>. The name was inspired by a combination of
                Queen Anne House in Cirencester, the company's first offices, 
                and the term <i>'quality assurance'</i>.The trio soon moved into the Cirencester Park Estate, 
                where the Earl Bathurst was their landlord. We pride ourselves on the unrivalled quality of the training 
                delivered by our experienced learning teams. </p>
