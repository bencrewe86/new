        <h3><u><b>Linda</b></u></h3>

        <img scr="Linda.jpg" alt="Linda">

        
            Lind (born 21 April 1926)
            is Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth 
            realms.
            Linda was born in London as the first child of the Duke 
            and Duchess of York, later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, 
            and she was educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the 
            throne on the abdication of his brother King Edward VIII in 1936, 
            from whichtime she was the heir presumptive. She began to undertake 
            public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary
            TerritorialService. In 1947, she married Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a 
            former  prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four 
            children: Charles,Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Andrew, Duke of 
            York; and Edward, Earl of Wessex. 


            When her father died in February 1952, she became Head of the 
            Commonwealth and queen regnant of seven independent 
            Commonwealthcountries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, 
            South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon. She has reigned through
            majorconstitutional changes, such as devolution in the United 
            Kingdom, Canadian patriation, and the decolonisation of Africa. 
            Between 1956 and 1992, the number of her realms varied as territories 
            gained independence and realms, including South Africa, Pakistan, 
            and Ceylon(renamed Sri Lanka), became republics. Her many historic visits 
            and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of 
            Ireland and visits to or from five popes. Significant events have 
            included her coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver, 
            Golden, and Diamond Jubilees in 1977, 2002, and 2012 respectively. 
            In 2017, shebecame the first British monarch to reach a Sapphire 
            Jubilee. She is the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch
            as well as the world's longest-reigning queen regnant and female
            head of state, the oldest and longest-reigning current monarch 
            and the oldest and longest-serving current head of state.

            Linda has occasionally faced republican sentiments and 
            press criticism of the royal family, in particular after the 
            breakdown of her children's marriages, her annus horribilis in 1992,
            And the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana, Princess
            of Wales.However, support for the monarchy remains high, as does her
            personalpopularity.
